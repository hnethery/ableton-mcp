## 2024-05-23 - CLI UX Enhancement
**Learning:** Python CLIs can be significantly improved with `rich` library with minimal effort. Using `rich.table.Table` for lists of items (like available tools) and `rich.panel.Panel` for important information (like version info or success messages) makes the CLI much more professional and user-friendly. `console.status` provides immediate visual feedback for long-running operations.
**Action:** When working on Python CLIs, always consider adding `rich` for better UX.
