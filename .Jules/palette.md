## 2024-05-23 - Installation UX Feedback
**Learning:** For CLI installation scripts, verbose per-file logging ("Copied X") creates noise that hides errors. Users prefer a "Searching..." indicator followed by a summary ("Copied N files") and clearly formatted Next Steps.
**Action:** When creating installation scripts, use summary statistics instead of individual file logs and group "Next Steps" into a visually distinct block.
